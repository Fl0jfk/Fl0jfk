            "description": "The development of the new Booki website is subject to a set of functional and technical specifications validated by the Product team. The functional specifications include the following features: 1. A search function that allows users to search for accommodations in a given city through an editable field. 2. Links to Accommodations and Activities in the header, directing users to the appropriate sections. 3. The ability to click on all accommodation or activity cards. 4. The capability to filter accommodations by theme, with mouse hover effects. It's important to note that the filters are not yet functional, as they are part of an initial version to validate the interface. On the technical side, three mockups have been designed for desktop, tablet, and mobile formats. Breakpoints are defined at 1024 px for desktop, 768 px for tablets, and below 768 px for phones. A maximum width of 1440 px is established to prevent excessive page expansion, with white space appearing beyond this width. The minimum width is set at 320 px. Development should follow a Desktop First approach, starting with desktops and then adapting to tablets and phones using Media Queries. Icons come from the Font Awesome library, and the colors used are blue (#0065FC), light blue (#DEEBFF), and gray (#F2F2F2) for the background. The recommended font is Raleway, accessible via Google Fonts. Flexbox is recommended for layout, and the use of semantic tags such as header, nav, h1-h2-h3, main, section, article, and footer is essential. Code validity is paramount, with requirements for HTML and CSS code that conforms to W3C validators. It is crucial to avoid unnecessary code duplication, prefer the use of CSS classes to target elements rather than using element names themselves, and ensure that HTML code does not contain CSS properties. Browser compatibility must be ensured for the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Finally, there are restrictions in place, including the prohibition of using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS, as well as CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less. No other languages, such as JavaScript, are allowed. Adhering to these specifications is essential to ensure the success of the development of the new Booki website.",

We'll need to search for and address the others based on Jean-Baptiste's requirements. Some of them can be detected through testing, so it's possible to find the bugs using failed tests.
